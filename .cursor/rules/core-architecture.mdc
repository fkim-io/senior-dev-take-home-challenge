# Core Architecture & Project Constraints

## Tech Stack Requirements
- **Backend**: Python 3.12+ with Django 5.1+ and Django REST Framework 3.15+
- **Task Queue**: Celery 5.4+ with Redis 7.2+ as broker and result backend
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ for persistence with psycopg 3.2+ adapter
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Python SDK 1.57+ for two-step GPT chain processing
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for single-command bootstrap
- **Testing**: pytest 8.3+ with pytest-django for 70%+ coverage requirement

**Version Strategy**: These versions ensure compatibility with modern security standards, performance optimizations, and active LTS support. PostgreSQL 15+ provides advanced JSONB features, Django 5.1+ offers improved async support, and Python 3.12+ delivers significant performance improvements over 3.11.

## Performance Requirements
- **POST /jobs** endpoint MUST respond in <200ms
- Support concurrent job processing with atomic operations
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Resource-conscious memory usage
- **Performance Testing**: All job creation operations must be tested to meet <200ms requirement
- **Concurrent Testing**: All status update operations must be tested for race condition safety

## Security Standards
- Never commit `.env` files or API keys
- Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- Proper error handling without exposing internals
- Use Django security best practices

```

## API Design Principles
- RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP status codes
- Consistent JSON response format
- OpenAPI 3.0 auto-generated documentation
- Error responses with meaningful messages
- Request/response validation using DRF serializers

## Database Design Standards
- Use UUIDs for event_id to avoid collisions
- Job status flow: PENDING → PROCESSING → COMPLETED/FAILED
- Atomic operations for status updates with `select_for_update()` for concurrent safety
- Worker coordination patterns to prevent job conflicts in multi-worker environments
- Proper indexing for performance queries with PostgreSQL 15+ advanced indexing
- JSON fields for storing GPT results using PostgreSQL native JSONB
- Connection pooling with psycopg 3.2+ for optimal performance
- Database constraints for data integrity (check constraints, unique constraints)
- Lifecycle timestamp tracking (started_at, completed_at) for monitoring and analytics

## Environment Configuration Standards
- **Environment-Aware Settings**: Use ENVIRONMENT variable to control development/testing/production behavior
- **Secure Defaults**: Fail securely in production (require SECRET_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY)
- **Environment Variables**: All configuration via environment variables with sensible defaults
- **Connection Pooling**: PostgreSQL CONN_MAX_AGE=60 with health checks enabled
- **Celery Integration**: Proper task discovery and worker configuration with Redis backend
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health/` and `/health/ready/` endpoints for container orchestration

## Health Endpoint Standards
```python
# Required health endpoints for container orchestration
/health/          # General health check (database + redis connectivity)
/health/ready/    # Readiness probe (all services ready)

# Response format:
{
    "status": "healthy|unhealthy|ready|not_ready",
    "database": "connected",
    "redis": "connected", 
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
    "environment": "development|testing|production"
}
```

## Code Quality Standards
- Follow PEP 8 with black formatting
- Type hints for all functions
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Meaningful variable and function names
- DRY principle with reusable utilities
