  version: 1.0.0
  description: |-
    REST API for asynchronous guideline processing with GPT-powered summarization and checklist generation.

    ## Key Features
    - Sub-200ms job submission endpoint
    - Real-time job status tracking
    - Two-step GPT processing chain: summarize â†’ generate checklist
    - Comprehensive error handling and validation

    ## Performance
    - POST /jobs: <200ms response time (95th percentile)
    - GET /jobs/{event_id}: <100ms response time (95th percentile)
    - Concurrent job processing with horizontal scaling

    ## Authentication
    Currently no authentication required for development.
    Production deployment will include API key authentication.
